# CSFD Magnets

Simple Chrome extension for ČSFD _(Czech-Slovak Movie Database)_.

**CSFD Magnets** adds a small widget within each **movie detail** to show information about **magnet links**... or something like that...

A picture is worth a thousand words.

## Privacy Policy

I DO NOT STORE ANY DATA. PERIOD.

I physically can't. I have nowhere to store it. I don't even have a server database to store it. So even if Justin Bieber asked nicely to see your data, I wouldn't have anything to show him.

That's why, with CSFD Magnets, what happens on your device stays on your device till disappear.
